    <h1>Garlic Bread</h1>
    <img src="../img/img_garlicbread.jpg" alt="Garlic bread picture">

    <h3>Garlic bread is the ultimate side dish, bursting with rich, buttery, and aromatic flavors. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, it’s made by slathering slices of crusty bread with a luscious mixture of melted butter, minced garlic, and fresh parsley. A sprinkle of salt enhances the savory notes, while optional Parmesan adds a nutty, cheesy depth.</h3>
    <h3>As it bakes, the garlic mellows, infusing the bread with a warm, earthy aroma. The golden, toasted edges provide a satisfying crunch, perfectly complementing the pillowy, buttery interior. Served warm, it’s the perfect partner for soups, pasta, or simply enjoyed on its own.</h3>
